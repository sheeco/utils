1
00:00:01,615 --> 00:00:05,608
I'm not the same person
that I was before the shooting.

2
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:12,990
THE ACTORS

3
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:17,224
AND THE JOURNALIST
OF IT ALL

4
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:21,826
Autumn in the country
can be really muggy.

5
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:25,099
If I'm so bad, then how come
I take home the money?

6
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:26,662
He's a sick man.

7
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:30,575
- Have you said different things?
- I understand the question.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,883
I do connect
with one of the monkeys.

9
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:41,547
Why are you so dressed up today?

10
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:44,682
- "Bryggeren"?
- No, I wasn't in that either.

11
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:47,990
Can I ask you something?

12
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:52,192
I decided to wear black.
It makes you look thinner.

13
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:55,133
- "Matador"?
- No. Before my time.

14
00:00:55,168 --> 00:01:00,265
- I wore it at the premiere.
- I can't remember that.

15
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:06,007
Anyone can call himself an actor
if he earns a million a year.

16
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:10,244
Auteur, director, Trier...
the words are connected.

17
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:15,277
Lars von Trier has joie de vivre.
He's a vibrant and playful man.

18
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:18,883
In this movie, he plays
with the medium once again.

19
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:22,326
It's called "Automavision."
Pre-fabricated images.

20
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:26,924
A computer has planned it all.
Trier has let the machine decide.

21
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:29,435
Utterly weird.

22
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:34,304
When I first heard about it
I didn't understand a damned thing.

23
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:38,675
It was a constant source of fun
because it's so stupid.

24
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:41,408
You have lots of actors,

25
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:44,417
and then the camera
opts to film a kitchen roll.

26
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:49,286
I thought, "What the hell
is he up to this time?"

27
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:53,088
There had to be some obstructions.

28
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:58,530
6 minutes' worth of kitchen roll
footage which will never be used.

29
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:04,827
Here's a new film.
It may look strange to you,

30
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:08,967
but hang in there. There's
something for everyone, I promise.

31
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,773
When does art become art?

32
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:16,476
When does it speak to the heart,
when does it speak to the mind?

33
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:18,711
These questions are...

34
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:23,883
Those are questions you have to ask
when you see a new Trier movie.

35
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:27,291
He's just made the comedy
"The Boss of It AII."

36
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:34,358
We've talked to the actors about art.
Comedy is fun. This is serious.

37
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:39,031
What was it like for you
to expose yourself so much

38
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:43,236
while also working with your
boyfriend, Casper Christensen?

39
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:46,803
Could you cope,
with him on the sideline?

40
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:51,409
Yes.
I thought it was great to see

41
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:58,516
how Casper came alive as an actor
in a more classical sense.

42
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:05,464
Are you done now?

43
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:10,869
- Iben, your part is a major one.
- Yes. It is.

44
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:14,203
It's required
a lot of preparation work.

45
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:18,234
Shut up. We'll be
more upset if you don't tell us.

46
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:23,511
- And clearly a difficult one.
- Yes, and you could say...

47
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:29,819
She's ambitious, you know.
She really wants to reach the top.

48
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:35,123
There'll be no banging
until you've had a good licking.

49
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:38,824
Trier has based your character
on your own life.

50
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:45,600
What's it like,
playing yourself in a movie?

51
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,632
Playing myself in a movie?

52
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:55,979
We use different sides of ourselves,
of course, but I'm not playing me.

53
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:59,577
- Overall, you mean?
- Yes, for example.

54
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,484
Well...

55
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:07,289
- He resembles you, doesn't he?
- According to Trier, he does.

56
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,818
But I'm not so sure.

57
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:13,993
He says you're quite soft
and inconsistent.

58
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:16,594
Do you see yourself that way?

59
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:20,970
There's nothing wrong
with being soft, but inconsistent...

60
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,805
Come on.

61
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:28,871
Up you go. That's it.
Big hug.

62
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:32,874
You helped Casper with his lines
and coached him, I guess.

63
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,015
- Did that help your own character?
- No, I have to say...

64
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:41,016
- Can I...?
- Hold on. Let me finish.

65
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:45,691
- Casper had to start from scratch.
- No, I didn't.

66
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:49,532
Yes, you did. Completely.

67
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:53,938
Mentally speaking, you're like
a newborn baby in this context.

68
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:58,536
Sofie, one of your big scenes
is in the zoo, at the monkey cage.

69
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:02,776
What do you do as an actor
to use the environment

70
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,807
and draw on that for your part?

71
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:10,685
I didn't have any dialogue
with them, you know.

72
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:14,091
Did you feel any connection
with the monkey?

73
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:20,760
It's embarrassing, but I can't
remember what they are. Baboons?

74
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:35,480
Jens Albinus, you've played with
Trier before. How was it this time?

75
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:40,243
I don't understand the question.

76
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:44,052
- You know him.
- I've never played with him.

77
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,049
No one has told me
you would ask about that.

78
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:52,121
What I meant was, you've
been in a Trier movie before.

79
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:55,498
Oh, yes. Right...

80
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:59,596
But it was different
this time around.

81
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,939
- It was completely different.
- In what way?

82
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:11,474
Let me just say that it has to do
with certain members of the cast.

83
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:17,388
My base of experience
is enormous, as you know.

84
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:22,418
I've created my own method...
the Gantzler Method as I call it...

85
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:28,298
so that when I get a new part
I know exactly how to approach it.

86
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:32,395
And this guy, Ravn,
was no exception.

87
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:38,071
He's called Ravn ("raven").
It's a bird. There's your opening.

88
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:45,040
Ravn, Ravn, Ravn...

89
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:48,179
- You haven't felt insecure?
- Not that much.

90
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:53,454
I don't run around like an idiot
with all your touchy-feely crap...

91
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:57,020
- Who do you think you are?
- I tell it like it is.

92
00:06:57,063 --> 00:07:01,261
You don't know anything.
You just come stomping in...

93
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:04,737
"I'll go in and impress
Lars von Trier..."

94
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:10,038
- Well, it works.
- No, it doesn't! You just sit there.

95
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:14,035
If it hadn't been for me
you would have looked like a dork.

96
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,207
You're this close, you know.

97
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:23,989
Can you be more specific?
What is it you want to say?

98
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:26,856
You have to watch what you say.

99
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:31,387
Peter, you're being very candid
about the Gantzler Method.

100
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:36,892
Was it a technical handle
that you and Trier talked about

101
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:40,997
developing along the way?

102
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,104
Let me put it this way.
I'm absolutely certain that Lars

103
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:53,245
was aware that I had
this very special technique.

104
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:57,450
We didn't discuss it that much.
Personally, I don't like

105
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,950
having people poke around
in my techniques.

106
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:05,226
But I've heard
through other people

107
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:09,292
that Lars has talked about me
in very positive terms...

108
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:12,827
not just as an individual,
but also as an actor.

109
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:15,807
He described the method
as being very valuable.

110
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:19,505
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

111
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:23,846
It's fine if you want to walk
through life with the hollow idea

112
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:26,443
that you have any talent at all.

113
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:30,547
I'm not listening to this shit.
I'd like to get out!

114
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:43,465
Fear is poetry, poetry is fear.
The two are closely linked

115
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:47,098
in the world of art,
in the world of Trier.

116
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,871
Many actors use fear
as a driving force.

117
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,006
So you could ask,
"Is fear a driving force?"

118
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:58,882
Louise, were you afraid
during the filming?

119
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:08,453
Yes, she was. A bit.

120
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:11,930
- What?
- Why do you say that?

121
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:17,369
As an actor, you're always afraid
of not being good enough.

122
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:22,670
And not being loved.
That's why we do it, you know.

123
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,143
- Were you afraid as well?
- Yes.

124
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,237
Yes. She was.

125
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:34,186
You joke a lot. Sometimes
I don't know exactly what to think.

126
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,281
I can't respond when I don't
know if it was a joke or not.

127
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:42,317
Do you have any experience
in working with monkeys?

128
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:46,628
Yes, I have.
I've tried it before.

129
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:51,262
Do you make any demands
in that sort of situation:

130
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:56,469
"This time I don't want
to touch the monkey"?

131
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:00,605
No. Did I want different animals
this time, you mean?

132
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:03,878
Yes, or contact with the monkeys,
quite simply.

133
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:07,114
- Sorry?
- That you didn't want that.

134
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:13,752
No, I can't say that. There's
a reason why he chose monkeys.

135
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:18,457
If that's what's best for the scene,
then I'm ready to do it.

136
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:22,059
The whole acting business
is incredibly hollow.

137
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:26,231
It's not something you can learn.
You either have it, or you don't.

138
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:29,605
I think Iben's got it.
She's really talented.

139
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:33,408
But she's getting older,
so she can't pick and choose.

140
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:42,546
Timing isn't something
you can learn in a school.

141
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:48,049
So all their National School
of Theatre crap...

142
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:51,757
running around, going
"Can you feel the sand?"

143
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:56,599
when there isn't any goddamn sand.
Who are you trying to fool?

144
00:10:56,636 --> 00:11:02,268
I've been an actor for 16 years.
I've been in 15-20 films.

145
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:07,507
- I'm thinking "Walter and Carlo"?
- No, that wasn't me.

146
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:10,778
Do you even know my name?

147
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:17,689
I've got the rare ability
to influence people around me

148
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:21,820
just by thinking certain things.

149
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:26,889
Therefore, if I see an actor
who hasn't quite got it,

150
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:31,461
I can mentally transfer
direction tips to Lars,

151
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:35,497
which he can then pass on.
Usually with great success.

152
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:41,173
Peter Gantzler is
a very, very sick man.

153
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:44,843
- What do you mean by that?
- Let's not get into that.

154
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:50,083
Peter Gantzler, a sick man?
He's just an actor, isn't he?

155
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:56,153
It's a good thing that I'm
the director, and you're just an actor.

156
00:11:56,195 --> 00:12:01,724
I sense a story behind your fear.
What is that story about?

157
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,696
It...

158
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,507
I'd rather not talk about it.
Don't say anything.

159
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:17,676
Gosh...

160
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:21,676
You must have been
afraid of Automavision?

161
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:25,885
We've actually invented this thing
called "Automa-action."

162
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:30,089
It's very similar.
When you pose a question,

163
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:36,227
you think you're getting the
corresponding answer, but you're not.

164
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:44,574
As an actor, does fear have to be
part of your toolbox, so to say?

165
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,637
No, I don't think so.
I think...

166
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:53,618
Well... the canteen food
was quite varied, don't you think?

167
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:59,023
It was... It was the highlight
of the day, you know?

168
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:03,961
Whether or not
you got any satisfaction...

169
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:06,931
foodwise.

170
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:12,268
It's about whether or not
you project. That's the thing.

171
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:17,800
If you've wasted four years,
fucking around, drinking beer,

172
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:22,838
trying to dance a certain color
in slippers... no wonder you're bitter.

173
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:28,184
When the rest of us can get by
just with high school, you know.

174
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:33,454
Which films have you been in?

175
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:37,190
There are so many.
I can't remember them all.

176
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:42,634
There's been... I've said no
to a lot of things as well.

177
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:45,068
Is it Trier you're afraid of?

178
00:13:57,283 --> 00:14:00,582
In what way do you feel
that Trier is an auteur?

179
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,391
Ask me about something else.

180
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:20,394
When Trier calls you do you think,
"Trier... that means awards"?

181
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:24,239
- "This will get me another award"?
- Yes.

182
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:29,510
If we talk ticket sales
or ratings

183
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:33,781
or "TV Host of The Year"
in the weekly magazines...

184
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:37,482
I don't know if you want to go
there, but if you do...

185
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:40,287
then yes, we've all won awards.

186
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:45,354
Have you noticed the drastic change
in the North Zealand weather

187
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:49,494
after we shot this movie?

188
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:53,301
- What?
- I live in the northern part.

189
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,469
The weather in my garden
hasn't been the same since.

190
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,674
- What's it got to do with Gantzler?
- Well, ask him that.

191
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:06,441
Not all actors are equally
responsive, you know.

192
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:09,215
And the casting on this film...

193
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:14,693
I didn't have time to give Lars
specific instructions about

194
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:19,061
who I would like to see
in the various parts,

195
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:24,627
so his choices are a bit...
shaky in places.

196
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,106
But... to err is human.

197
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:34,238
But it was difficult,
especially with...

198
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,214
with Jens.

199
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:40,276
I've got this spot between
the second and third vertebrae

200
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:43,220
which hasn't been the same since.

201
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:47,488
And every time I hear his name
it gets worse.

202
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:50,689
God, I'm furious!

203
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,732
Ravn is the key character,
so it's important to me

204
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:04,835
that Jens respects the fact that
I'm the star, and follows my lead.

205
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:09,246
That was hard for him.
He clearly has no method whatsoever.

206
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:16,017
He's out of a very different,
more clownlike tradition, perhaps.

207
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:20,185
It's terribly difficult
to work with sometimes.

208
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:27,924
You're just acting scared now.

209
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:31,903
Yeah, that's right. I am.

210
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:38,035
We're just acting.

211
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:41,376
That's an actor's specialty.

212
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:45,646
- Were you in "The Idiots"?
- Yes, I was, actually.

213
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:48,848
- Have you seen it?
- I've seen some clips.

214
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:54,190
- We don't see all the films.
- No, of course. There are so many.

215
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:57,195
Of course I do. Thank you.

216
00:16:57,229 --> 00:17:03,395
Do you go for both the Bodil and
Robert Awards when you choose a part?

217
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:07,998
No. I go for
the Bodil Award, primarily.

218
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:15,210
- How believable was that line?
- Not bad.

219
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:20,184
The Robert Awards are a bit
more unpredictable, to be honest.

220
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:25,384
They're harder to plan for.
It seems very random.

221
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:29,588
You can look at something
and say, "This is Bodil material"?

222
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:32,654
Yes.

223
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:35,895
Didn't you feel
like an outsider sometimes?

224
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:41,100
Yes. I can't be so narcissistic,
stare at myself in the mirror

225
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,837
and do my hair for hours
like Peter Gantzler did.

226
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:49,007
But I've had other experiences
that they haven't had

227
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:53,246
because they were up in some loft,
doing improvisations.

228
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:58,086
The rest of us were out there
doing stand-up and making big money.

229
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:01,491
We're talking free drinks,
full throttle,

230
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:06,294
chicks and the rest of it.
That's what makes a man.

231
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:13,534
You can't ask more of a man than
what he can give. In that way...

232
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:18,475
I felt sorry for Jens.
He clearly wasn't up to the job.

233
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:25,747
And it's true that I taunted him
sometimes. Put him in his place.

234
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:31,746
Would you feel better if we didn't
talk about Peter Gantzler at all?

235
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:37,752
- That's probably the best thing.
- Jens, this movie...

236
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:41,255
No, stop it.
I can't do it anymore.

237
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,862
Trier's movies are very arty-farty,
I guess.

238
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:50,467
But Trier is an extremely
insecure man.

239
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:56,778
When he meets someone like me
who isn't, he attaches himself to me.

240
00:18:56,816 --> 00:19:00,946
He calls me and says,
"What do I do? I don't want to fly."

241
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:05,389
I tell him,
"Goddamn it, Trier. Drive!"

242
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:11,090
You don't get that look from the
others, "She's won a lot of awards"?

243
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,032
- You'll have to ask them.
- You don't feel it?

244
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,831
I think I choose to shut it out.

245
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,806
Hasn't Trier won more awards
than me? He must have.

246
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:27,402
I wouldn't say I'm his mentor
or coach. I'm more a kind of rock

247
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:33,214
on which he can place
his film genius, perhaps.

248
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:37,621
- You bring Trier into a new era?
- No, he does that himself.

249
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:43,856
But we all know that if Iron Maiden
play a concert in Edinburgh...

250
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:47,593
they do the performing,
but how did they get there?

251
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:52,502
With your enormous
mental resources...

252
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:56,304
- I think it's safe to say that?
- Yes.

253
00:19:56,342 --> 00:20:00,904
The resources that you have,
in this situation as well...

254
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:04,780
Right now? Yes.

255
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:10,687
If you were to draw on that to give
Lars von Trier some advice

256
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:15,422
to take with him
on his journey,

257
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:21,161
what would it be?

258
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,694
"When you can't be like me, Lars,
just be yourself."

259
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,534
Yes.

260
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:34,512
What's been
your best advice to him?

261
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:37,539
It must have been...

262
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:41,246
"Deep breaths, Lars.
Just get going.

263
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:45,917
Forget about doing
new things all the time.

264
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,949
Drop it. Let's have some fun."

265
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:54,762
When people look back at my films
in a hundred years' time,

266
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:01,569
they'll probably say, "Bloody hell!
That guy knew what he was doing."

267
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:06,738
I'll just go and check
that Iben is okay.

268
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,873
She's got the car keys, so...

269
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:16,150
- Don't you have any more questions?
- Yes.

270
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:18,986
We're just acting, aren't we?

271
00:21:19,024 --> 00:21:22,551
- Are you acting?
- Yes. Couldn't you tell?

272
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:28,227
- No.
- Great acting. I really tried.

273
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:41,905
You've experienced it for yourself.
The insight into the world of art.

274
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:46,145
Powerlessness, power.
Joy, enthusiasm, feelings... fear.

275
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:51,782
Reality, parallel reality...
Thank you for watching.

276
00:21:51,824 --> 00:22:00,391
When you turn up in the morning,
ready to shoot some scene...

277
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:05,301
it's like entering...

278
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:09,706
- different rooms.
- What rooms?

279
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:14,611
And one of those rooms
that you're constantly in

280
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:20,017
is the room filled with fear,
I guess.

281
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:24,113
If you don't want to do
the interview that we agreed on,

282
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:29,458
you can say whatever
you want. I'm leaving!

283
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:33,090
That's okay.

284
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:37,466
You can't help laughing
when you're fearful.

285
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,495
That's perfect. Brilliant.
Cut!

286
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:55,567
Why does he ask me that?

287
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:04,117
There was a bit more nonsense
in this one.

288
00:29:04,151 --> 00:29:06,915
- I'm so involved with my work.
- That's good.

289
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,946
- "Pip."
- "Pip."

290
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,787
He's fabulous.

291
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:21,228
Let me just have a look.

292
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,086
- And this one is all of the text?
- Yes, it's those two.

293
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,223
I'll get these onto some cardboard.

294
00:32:38,265 --> 00:32:43,100
"And even though I may seem
like a reflection, this film is not."

295
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:50,475
I'm happy with it.
That's a punch right in their faces.

296
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:55,312
Put it there,
and I'll go up and have a look.

297
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,546
Put one here by my finger.

298
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:01,577
- That's nothing.
- There you go.

299
00:33:09,763 --> 00:33:16,032
I'd like a movement going
diagonally across the windows.

300
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:22,369
This is some toy.

301
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:29,076
If this looks odd already, please stay,
because it won't be difficult.

302
00:36:29,607 --> 00:36:33,099
- That's good.
- It's super! That's it.

303
00:37:04,576 --> 00:37:09,275
- 13 degrees to the left.
- That won't work.

304
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:15,082
- It's the wrong direction.
- Let's have a new one.

305
00:37:49,954 --> 00:37:53,287
Tilt down 11 degrees.

306
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:58,785
And 33 centimeters to the left.
You'll like this, Lars.

307
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:03,563
Well, if you're happy, I'm happy.
