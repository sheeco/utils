1
00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:41,346
<i>Here comes a movie</i>
<i>and, if it already looks a bit weird</i>.

2
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:44,652
<i>then hang in there</i>,
<i>because anyone can see it</i>.

3
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:47,819
<i>Although you see my reflection</i>,
<i>trust me</i>.

4
00:00:47,894 --> 00:00:51,193
<i>this film won't be worth</i>
<i>a moment's reflection</i>.

5
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:56,600
<i>It's a comedy, and harmless as such</i>.
<i>No preaching or swaying of opinion</i>.

6
00:00:56,703 --> 00:01:03,370
<i>Just a cozy time. So why not</i>
<i>poke fun at artsy-fartsy culture?</i>

7
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:09,746
<i>So here we have a self-important</i>
<i>out-of-work actor</i>

8
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,414
<i>who, by miraculous chance, got a job</i>.
<i>A very special job</i>.

9
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,524
Hello. So we finally meet.
I'm the company president.

10
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:26,896
I'm the company president.

11
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:31,233
I've given Mr. Ravn power of attorney
to conclude the deal.

12
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:34,364
Hello again..."Optional."

13
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:39,068
- Kristoffer? Butterflies?
- No.

14
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:44,812
Let's get this done.
It's our non-disclosure agreement.

15
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:49,719
You said
you'd never written for the stage?

16
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,729
May I ask why?
This text is succinct and intense.

17
00:01:55,796 --> 00:02:00,756
- But it says far more than it says.
- Really?

18
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:04,793
I had hoped it would say
as little as possible.

19
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:09,936
The sanctions might seem drastic,
but that's law for you.

20
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:14,309
The main thing
is that you keep this a secret.

21
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:17,747
- Secret?
- But you're used to that.

22
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:24,246
You don't shoot someone on stage
and tell the crowd: "I'm only acting."

23
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:26,622
I don't know.

24
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:33,757
That particular statement applies to
many of Gambini's anti-characters.

25
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:38,498
- I'm your man, Ravn.
- Great. You're playing the boss.

26
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:41,335
I'm in a bit of a pinch

27
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:46,140
because the real boss is...
not accessible.

28
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:50,478
We must act now.
The Icelanders are so damn pushy.

29
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,348
It won't take too long,

30
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:58,390
so you'll be making quite a bundle,

31
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:02,451
seeing as you're not working.
Sign here.

32
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:07,557
I don't keep busy
just to be busy.

33
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:13,196
- It's not illegal or anything!
- Legal or illegal, I don't care.

34
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm an actor. The character is my law.
And the script is my court.

35
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:22,911
Court?
Let's pray it never gets that far.

36
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:29,854
Excellent...
Your money.

37
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:35,317
- What's that on your forehead?
- Soot.

38
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:40,492
I always rely on Gambini.
You can't go wrong.

39
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,296
<i>The Hanged Cat?</i>.

40
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:46,897
The chimney sweep's monologue
from <i>A Town without Chimneys</i>.

41
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:51,068
- You know it?
- I only know <i>Top Cat</i>.

42
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:57,582
"I have traveled far,
and with reluctance, to this town."

43
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:00,949
Our president doesn't have soot
on his forehead.

44
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:06,390
The things a character doesn't have
define him more than what he has.

45
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:13,228
Theater begins to unfold itself
at the point where it ends.

46
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:19,699
Don't make me nervous, Kristoffer.

47
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:22,742
Let's keep it simple.

48
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:28,608
I'll just endow my character
with a small tribute to Gambini.

49
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:33,277
Fine! It won't make any difference.
You're only the boss for a moment.

50
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:38,483
Then there's the pauses...
So vital to our understanding.

51
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:43,393
He could actually
not say anything at all.

52
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:48,223
You have to say what's on the page.

53
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:52,795
Otherwise, what's the point?
Just what's on the page.

54
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:56,433
Hello. So we finally meet.
I'm the company president.

55
00:04:57,944 --> 00:05:02,142
I finally tracked him down.

56
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:04,307
This is Finnur...

57
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:16,954
"Hello. So we finally meet.
I'm the company president."

58
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:28,430
Hello. So we finally meet.
I'm the company president.

59
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:40,286
Yes, both you gents
are indeed company presidents.

60
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:43,618
But for two different companies.

61
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:58,727
"Why do Danes talk so much?

62
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:04,174
"No wonder this country came to
a halt intellectually 200 years ago.

63
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:11,514
"They yak away
or are drippingly sentimental.

64
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:14,348
"The rest of the time they giggle."

65
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:24,221
"Let's for God's sake
get started, Mr. Ravn."

66
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,798
Dear Mr. President -

67
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:31,064
and I'm referring to
our own little president -

68
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:35,369
We're happy just
to have a president.

69
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:40,941
I want to say the following...

70
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:46,747
Our president has requested
to be kept out of the negotiations.

71
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,549
Did I get that right?

72
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:53,058
The price is our top priority.

73
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:57,028
And we've already agreed on it.

74
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,030
I have...

75
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:10,367
turned over...

76
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:16,210
power...

77
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:18,978
of attorney...

78
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:24,657
to Mr...

79
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,652
Ravn.

80
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:39,401
I'm sorry...
I didn't quite get that.

81
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:42,236
The pauses confused me.

82
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:47,075
Would you mind
repeating it a bit quicker?

83
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:52,813
I have turned over
power of attorney to Mr. Ravn.

84
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:03,521
Once our president's mind is made up,
no amount of ruckus can change it.

85
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:06,761
Mr. President...

86
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:13,102
All these presidents! Should we
call ours "the Danish president"?

87
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:18,175
Icelandic or Danish... Same thing!

88
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:23,511
- 400 jolly years under Icelandic rule.
- It was the other way round.

89
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:28,013
It sure as hell
didn't feel that way to us.

90
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:29,520
No.

91
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,823
Well, I better get back to the States.

92
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:45,627
Just because I'll sign on the 12th
doesn't make it less fun.

93
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:58,911
"You fucking Danes
aren't getting off that lightly.

94
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:03,488
"It's all talk, fucking slave drivers!

95
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:12,860
"Fortunately the sagas left us
these wise words:

96
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:17,232
"He who deals with stooges
deals with nobody."

97
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:22,663
- Goodbye.
- Finnur!

98
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:31,383
"I insist that the president

99
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:35,410
"deal with me on the 12th.
Not his stooge.

100
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:45,354
"He'll have to stay home that week
or there's no deal.

101
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:48,366
"You'll be hearing from my lawyer."

102
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:51,528
Bye then..."Optional."

103
00:09:55,875 --> 00:10:00,608
Hello. So we finally meet.
I'm the company president.

104
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:12,083
Shit! They weren't
supposed to see you.

105
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:18,460
- Word will spread like wildfire.
- They could tell I wasn't for real.

106
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:23,729
- They had no time to tell Finnur...
- That's not the problem.

107
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:28,570
They looked shocked because they
thought you were the real president.

108
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,671
Well, I did play him well.

109
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:36,715
Although you didn't give me
much to work with.

110
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,751
If the performance is topnotch

111
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:43,585
physical resemblance
has less significance.

112
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:48,923
The physical resemblance with their
president of ten years is irrelevant.

113
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:55,457
They've never seen him.

114
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:00,467
- Never seen him?
- No.

115
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:04,976
- I don't quite get it.
- If I wasn't such a wuss.

116
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:09,845
Companies need presidents.
I didn't have it in me.

117
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:13,942
I couldn't see myself as one.

118
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:20,118
So when I started the company
I told them I was an employee.

119
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:24,857
That the president was tending to
his companies and lived in the States.

120
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:31,369
I know it's strange and suspicious.
A boss that I invented, Kristoffer.

121
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:35,737
It was fine as long as
no one wanted to talk to him.

122
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:41,906
Then that fucking Icelander came along.
They don't trust anyone.

123
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:47,143
Strange...
They called Gambini strange too.

124
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,317
Look...
I told you I was your man.

125
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:57,159
I am... And not just any man.
I'm an actor.

126
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,758
That's exactly what you need
to make your world work.

127
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:10,508
- It's only a week. I'll write a contract.
- No need.

128
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,441
It's a hobby of mine.

129
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:18,848
This deal is vital to the company.
The slightest doubt...

130
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:24,356
I have considerable training in sensing
doubt in the minds of my audience.

131
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:31,523
- You'll have to meet the staff.
- Being seen is part of the job.

132
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:38,303
- If you talk, I'll slaughter you!
- Stop fussing.

133
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:47,545
Heidi A? Would you get
the six seniors together?

134
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:51,413
I want you to meet someone special.

135
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:54,578
They're the six I started out with.

136
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,863
Here at last...
The boss of it all.

137
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:18,338
He took a week out of his schedule
to be with us in Denmark.

138
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:23,677
Probably because deep down inside
he's... Danish.

139
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:29,418
And perhaps
he feels he has...

140
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:34,825
maybe not <i>abandoned</i>,
but <i>neglected</i> our little branch.

141
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:39,159
Yes, that's understandable.

142
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:43,796
That's understandable.

143
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:46,838
Yes, that <i>is</i> understandable.

144
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:50,636
So there's lots for you to talk about.

145
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:59,615
I guess I'll stick my tail
between my legs, as they say...

146
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:02,711
and scoot on back to my office.

147
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:18,962
Any questions?

148
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:22,303
What's your name?

149
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,572
- My name?
- Yes.

150
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:31,207
No one's ever called you
anything but "the boss of it all."

151
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:37,051
Some of the girls had the honor of
getting emails with specific details.

152
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:42,685
Let me make it clear
that it's been at random,

153
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:47,095
who I needed to write
directly to over the years.

154
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,169
There's no personal preference there.

155
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:54,798
Holy smoke...
One does have to be careful.

156
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:59,277
- His name is Svend.
- Svend E.

157
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:04,179
That's what my emails said.
What does the E stand for?

158
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:09,718
Didn't I write that?
Ravn didn't say?

159
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:13,519
For ten years? Never, ever?!

160
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:19,532
That's good news.
Because that means...

161
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:24,229
I can tell you that
I have a name I'm very partial to...

162
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:28,068
and proud of.

163
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:31,143
Ecker...

164
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:36,580
Eckersberg...
Svend Eckersberg.

165
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:44,288
- And what should I call you?
- Gorm wants to call you Svend.

166
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,121
Gorm may call me
whatever he likes.

167
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:52,789
Gorm may even call me Kristoffer,
if he likes.

168
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:56,390
Why should he call you Kristoffer?

169
00:15:56,469 --> 00:16:00,906
No, why on earth should he?
Why in the world should he?

170
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:04,841
- By all means, call me Svend.
- OK, Svend.

171
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:08,141
I'd like to say one thing.

172
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:12,513
- Autumn in the country is muggy.
- Gorm, don't.

173
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:16,054
Real muggy!
I want you to know that.

174
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:21,822
People generally think
autumn has a freshness to it.

175
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:26,430
No, Gorm!

176
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:33,869
- Are you done now? Huh?!
- Everything's cool.

177
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:37,534
- Are you done?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

178
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:41,204
Everything is perfectly fine.

179
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:48,048
Stop it!

180
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:54,390
Boy, that's nasty.

181
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:59,462
I'm afraid you'll have to apologize.

182
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:02,831
Should I apologize to him?!

183
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:08,867
Don't forget
the tech conference tomorrow.

184
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:10,669
Tech conference...

185
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:22,150
Ravn...
They're all completely insane.

186
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:26,817
- We need to talk.
- On neutral ground! I'll call you.

187
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:31,729
OK.

188
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:40,801
If my character's name is Svend,
for example,

189
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:43,501
then I'd like to know.

190
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:47,569
- I just want to be in the loop.
- Sure.

191
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,706
The names didn't really matter.

192
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:56,016
Gorm is a country boy. He sometimes
suffers from rural depression.

193
00:17:56,722 --> 00:18:01,591
- But he's a wizard with Brooker 5.
- What the hell is that?

194
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:06,222
Our flagship, our biggest seller.
That's what we started out with.

195
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,871
My character doesn't like
when they cry, shout or hit.

196
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:18,876
My personal space has been violated.

197
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:23,813
I must insist on control.
They must be subdued.

198
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,943
The six seniors
can be a bit of a hassle.

199
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:31,045
They're the creative bunch
in the firm.

200
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:36,390
I don't know about the psychology
of actors, but I imagine it's similar.

201
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:41,422
So things are that bad?

202
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:46,028
I love them dearly. Although they have
knocked me around a bit.

203
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:49,370
It can't be as bad
as Slagelse in 1992.

204
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:54,243
Though I did talk the women
ticket holders down after the show.

205
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:59,910
I didn't know Slagelse had a theater.
And they didn't, artistically speaking.

206
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:10,961
- What's wrong? What was that?
- My mournful and remote look.

207
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:16,229
- It must terrify people.
- Yes, it's effective.

208
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:20,830
The six seniors
were more feisty than I'd expected.

209
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,773
This tech conference
sounds ominous.

210
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:29,475
Tell me about what you do,
so I can learn the lingo.

211
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:32,312
IT.

212
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:37,185
That's impossible to grasp!
I don't stand a chance.

213
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:43,527
Good thing
you're such a good actor.

214
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:49,033
You're prepared now.
Subdue them, take control.

215
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:51,329
All right?

216
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,748
Wow...

217
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:13,421
It's quite a shocker
when the copy machine starts.

218
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:19,887
Luckily it's not that often.
Only a thousand times a day.

219
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:34,201
How's the weather
out in the country today?

220
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:39,177
Well, let's just assume

221
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:44,587
that it's wintry like it is
throughout the country.

222
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:51,689
Looking for your office?

223
00:20:52,831 --> 00:20:58,394
I figured the office would be
a safer bet than the corridors.

224
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:02,338
Safer?
What do you mean?

225
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:06,902
So people can find me.
Since I'm here rather seldom.

226
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:11,973
So you want to see them?
I told them to wait. I'll pass it on.

227
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:16,987
- Thanks.
- Jokumsen is waiting outside.

228
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:20,115
I don't know how he found out
you were here.

229
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:24,252
It's the deficiency list
for the DB 7 patch.

230
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:29,358
I doubt if he's lightened up
since he last complained.

231
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:32,927
Should we push Jokumsen
till after the tech conference?

232
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:46,809
Sorry. He's acted as our boss
when the boss wasn't here.

233
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,082
We start off
with the management's visions.

234
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:54,319
I'd like to hear more
about the visions.

235
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:58,453
I studied the old
corporate philosophy.

236
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:06,437
And, as such, certain technical and
strategic measures seem most unclear.

237
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:20,279
Transaction hierarchy... Why not?
The 80:20 rule. Agile development.

238
00:22:20,352 --> 00:22:24,220
That's just a minor part
of the terms necessary

239
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:27,554
to define IT
at an acceptable level.

240
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,151
Aside from those fucking terms,

241
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:34,666
what's the boss' definition
of transaction hierarchy?

242
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:40,638
And the 80:20 rule?
Maybe I dozed off, but what is it?

243
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:46,235
"Agile development" is defined
in seven or eight different ways.

244
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:49,041
How would you define it?

245
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:09,157
Define...
"Dictate," I'm tempted to say.

246
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:13,866
There is a very fine line
between defining and dictating.

247
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:20,104
And it all boils down to
whether the boss wants to dictate.

248
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:25,673
Or rather whether the boss has
any idea what we do in this company.

249
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:30,950
Or whether you have any idea
what we do at this company.

250
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:35,356
- I should certainly say so.
- What, then?

251
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:39,454
- What?
- What we do?

252
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:42,932
Didn't you prepare a presentation?
What do we do?

253
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:48,337
- This and that. In general?
- Yes, for example.

254
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:51,535
Uhh...

255
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,237
Uh...

256
00:23:53,312 --> 00:23:59,581
Hi, everyone.
I just have a practical announcement.

257
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:04,486
Oh, Nalle... Such a pouty face.
Come on.

258
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:11,055
Upsy-daisy...
and a big hug.

259
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:15,966
What was the practical nature
of your announcement, Ravn?

260
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:23,598
The trip to Kullen is off.

261
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:30,938
But we were going
because we didn't go last year.

262
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:37,080
Can anybody tell me... what... that?

263
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:42,419
- Keep quiet, Spencer.
- Work on it.

264
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:46,021
I am afraid
the decision came from above.

265
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:52,161
I know it reflects
a hard policy about perks.

266
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:54,796
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good reason.

267
00:24:54,873 --> 00:25:00,209
The reason we're not going is
because the boss of it all says so.

268
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:05,542
"Because the boss of it all says so."
That's a fucking old line.

269
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:10,384
Why don't the six of us just take
our rights to Brooker 5 and leave?

270
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:15,222
- Be nice, Gorm.
- But you're not nice to us.

271
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:20,788
We all agree we'd be far better off
without the fucking boss of it all.

272
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:25,667
Let's not dampen the good mood.
It's my fault. And this conference

273
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:30,697
is not for debating whether
the boss is a hard-ass or not.

274
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:34,210
Let's hear what Svend has to say.

275
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:40,810
- Svend?
- Come on, Svend!

276
00:25:54,066 --> 00:26:00,164
We usually get the sales figures,
though not at the tech conference.

277
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:03,834
Maybe you can give us an idea,
if you've seen them.

278
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:09,575
- Of course I have seen them.
- So how do they look?

279
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:16,180
They're shit.

280
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:25,920
Now it's finally out.
They're shit.

281
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:28,090
They're piss.

282
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,532
They're pig swill.

283
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:33,935
We need to turn this ship round!

284
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:36,769
Those figures had better
look completely different.

285
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:41,312
- Now it's out in the open.
- There, Mette.

286
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:44,644
But the figures look fine in your mails.

287
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,310
Did Mette say they were fine?

288
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:51,549
All I can say, Mette,

289
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:54,456
is that they aren't good enough.

290
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,256
Far, far from it, Mette.

291
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:07,229
- Now poor Mette is crying again.
- There, Mette.

292
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:10,298
They're just numbers.

293
00:27:17,616 --> 00:27:23,145
They are lined up outside. You want
to see Lise and Spencer, or Jokumsen?

294
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:28,056
Anyone but Jokumsen.
His complaint seems legitimate.

295
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:35,891
- Lise is our HR representative.
- Sure, why not?

296
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:41,565
- Spencer has something to say.
- We will work longer...

297
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,667
- No longer.
- No longer.

298
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:52,307
We will no longer
accept thighs...

299
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:54,682
- These.
...working conditions.

300
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:58,916
It's easier for me to say it
when you can't say it properly.

301
00:27:58,991 --> 00:28:01,357
He means "working conditions."

302
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,829
Our working conditions are dreadful.
So is the personnel policy.

303
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:11,767
Other companies have perks.
Here's a list.

304
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:15,933
Would you mind leaving, Heidi?

305
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:18,738
All the way out.

306
00:28:18,844 --> 00:28:24,476
So you are affiliated
with certain biker circles.

307
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:28,041
I would be naive to think

308
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:31,748
their racket is limited
to small shopkeepers.

309
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:35,384
With the Hell's Angels
up your sleeve,

310
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:41,763
your demands require a different approach.
But keep quiet about it.

311
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:50,902
HR. HR.

312
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:55,174
Human Resources.
You've been in the States so long,

313
00:28:55,247 --> 00:29:00,742
you can't remember what it means.
I'll look it up for you in English.

314
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:02,911
You can tell me.

315
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:08,757
You can fess up.

316
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:14,821
I discussed it with the others.
We think you have a credibility problem.

317
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:22,203
Your personality gives you away.

318
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:25,072
You're not who you pretend to be.

319
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:29,305
I think you should come clean.

320
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:38,220
You think that's a wise thing
to do at this point?

321
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,384
- You think so?
- Yes.

322
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:46,420
It wouldn't change much.
You're so transparent.

323
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:49,797
All your lines really lack cred.

324
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:53,428
It's lousy acting
from start to finish.

325
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,972
My lines lack cred?

326
00:30:00,112 --> 00:30:05,414
You are too much!
Let's not forget "lousy acting."

327
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:08,817
That's when audiences
are shook up.

328
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,686
Don't they get that
the point of comedy nowadays

329
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,919
is to reveal the comedy?

330
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:20,124
Disaster has already struck.
It's all in the aftermath.

331
00:30:20,198 --> 00:30:26,103
People just want things to be credible
and natural. Give me a fucking break!

332
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:28,969
- You have a credibility problem.
- No, I don't.

333
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:31,338
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

334
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:38,113
I don't know much about you,
but I know what you aren't.

335
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:44,015
Then tell me what I'm not,
for fuck's sake!

336
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:46,181
Gay.

337
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:50,286
- Gay?
- Yes, gay.

338
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:55,963
It's not so much that you try
to make me think you're gay,

339
00:30:56,034 --> 00:31:01,700
but you also pretend to be oblivious
to IT, management,

340
00:31:01,806 --> 00:31:05,970
and even Human Resources.
Hell's Angels. Honestly!

341
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:10,811
Of course you're an expert, otherwise
you would never have made it this big.

342
00:31:10,882 --> 00:31:13,180
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

343
00:31:14,553 --> 00:31:18,421
Why would you think I was gay?

344
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:23,421
All those emails you sent me,
distancing yourself from me.

345
00:31:23,528 --> 00:31:28,488
- And you got Ravn to plant the idea.
- What pleasure would I get from that?

346
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:34,563
The same you get from looking like
a complete jackass, professionally.

347
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:38,905
To seem interesting
or make us feel sorry for you.

348
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:42,879
You hit home with that one.

349
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:50,354
The thing about pretending
to be completely oblivious to IT,

350
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:54,552
it was a bit naive, I admit.

351
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:59,063
- But I am gay.
- You don't seem gay at all.

352
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:04,534
That's how some of us are.
And it's not to win you over.

353
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:07,936
Sorry about that.

354
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,304
I've been a cornholer since birth.

355
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:13,934
There is no explanation for it.

356
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:17,879
But rather a poop pusher
than a dry old stick.

357
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:25,220
I can explain
why you've always gone for men.

358
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:31,558
You haven't met
the right woman yet.

359
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,600
On neutral ground, ASAP.

360
00:32:51,016 --> 00:32:55,976
I'm exhausted, fumbling in the dark.
No control whatsoever.

361
00:32:56,087 --> 00:33:00,751
It would be easier if I knew
what I had said or written in my past.

362
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:05,194
I mean, gay!
You could have told me.

363
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:09,598
- Dammit, Ravn!
- You're right.

364
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:12,501
But only Lise's president is gay.

365
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:16,306
You told them different things?!

366
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:22,646
I hear you.

367
00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:27,014
- You told them different things?
- I understand the question.

368
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:30,284
Are you a complete idiot?

369
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,019
It created a good vibe.

370
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:44,364
Everyone felt he belonged to them.
And in that sense, he did.

371
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:50,999
- And that IT shit? I don't get it.
- Me neither.

372
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:54,840
- You're doing great.
- You think?

373
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:57,814
Stick it out a couple of more days.

374
00:33:57,882 --> 00:34:02,717
Take my advice, Kristoffer.
Don't take it so seriously.

375
00:34:03,855 --> 00:34:08,724
All that stuff about controlling
and subduing is probably fine,

376
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:10,727
but it's easier not to.

377
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:14,287
Make the audience do the work.

378
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:16,834
Then you won't feel so stressed out.

379
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:20,667
Just say yes.
When they come to you - "Yes."

380
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:24,072
Maybe not so artistic,
but it works.

381
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:29,169
Say yes!
But that's improvisational theater.

382
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:36,449
Like when some jackass gets it
into his head he should put on a dress,

383
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:42,254
and we all have to applaud it.
Gambini didn't believe in it.

384
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,559
To him, improvisation was just
kowtowing to the parlor drama.

385
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:52,864
Gambini was one of the first
to see through lbsen. Ibsen was a moron!

386
00:34:52,937 --> 00:34:56,703
Too prim to grab disaster
by the throat.

387
00:34:57,509 --> 00:35:00,410
Why not go straight to soap?

388
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:03,936
With all its sentimentality
and fucking clichés.

389
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:08,815
"This is not <i>adieu</i>, but <i>au revoir</i>!"
Or shit like that. It's bull.

390
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,617
- It's bull. Bull.
- Sure.

391
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:18,157
Calm down.

392
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:23,758
I'm sorry. You know best.
It's your character and idea.

393
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:27,566
And the idea is God.
Even Hitler's.

394
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:32,633
If you want improvisation
and group theater, I'll give it to you.

395
00:35:32,744 --> 00:35:36,578
I'll say yes,
until you choke on it.

396
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:42,784
But not to Jokumsen. He has had
a legitimate complaint for six years.

397
00:35:42,854 --> 00:35:47,484
- Why didn't he come six years ago?
- He did.

398
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:51,722
But the boss of it all
wasn't in that day.

399
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,800
- Oh, I see.
- And about those IT terms?

400
00:35:57,902 --> 00:36:02,430
When they say "outsourcing,"
they mean "offshoring."

401
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:04,873
Piece of cake.

402
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:16,779
The cLib module performance issues
are more extensive than we thought.

403
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:19,949
Bottlenecks throughout the system.

404
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:23,824
We should put
far more validations client-side.

405
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:29,265
Outsourcing is very tempting,
but as the cLib module...

406
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:31,393
Excuse me.

407
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,462
You mean offshoring.

408
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:43,170
You said outsourcing,
but you mean offshoring.

409
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:47,009
Of course.
Thank you, Svend.

410
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:56,521
What does the boss of it all say?
Do Nalle and Mette get a green light?

411
00:36:56,594 --> 00:37:01,531
- You mean yes or no?
- I think I can answer that.

412
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:05,433
We all can.
"A third cheaper and we go ahead."

413
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:10,966
- Is Nalle right in his assumption?
- Yes.

414
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:16,069
The boss of it all has spoken.

415
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,274
You just had
to take Nalle down a peg.

416
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:26,448
Rap his knuckles with everyone watching.
You're a real bastard.

417
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,787
Yes.

418
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:36,730
Upsy-daisy.
And a big hug.

419
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:42,535
Cute, right? Like a little baby.
No, wait, babies mean procreation,

420
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:46,543
and that entails screwing
members of the opposite sex.

421
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:59,550
If you have any questions
or requests of me,

422
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:03,083
then the answer might be yes.

423
00:38:04,462 --> 00:38:08,865
Is there anything I can say?
Or that anyone can say?

424
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:13,366
They might say yes.

425
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:17,541
Or yes, yes, yes.

426
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:28,813
- I've had it, Svend. You read me?
- Yes.

427
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,583
You better!
All your gay crap.

428
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:37,185
- I know when a man lusts after me.
- Yes.

429
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:41,254
- You're such a tease.
- Yes.

430
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:48,439
All those emails. "Be nice to Ravn, Lise.
Take care of Ravn."

431
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:51,839
- They were meant to get me going.
- Yes.

432
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,779
That faggy farce is all very well,
but there are better fish to fry.

433
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:01,613
- Fine by me.
- Yes.

434
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:06,688
- As long as you're in control, right?
- Yes.

435
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:13,153
Right here, right now.
The sooner the better.

436
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:18,359
- You male chauvinist pig.
- Yes.

437
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:25,366
There will be no fucking
till you get a proper blow-job.

438
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:40,150
And now, over the desk I go.
That's just the way it is.

439
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:42,522
- Yes.
- Right?

440
00:39:43,528 --> 00:39:48,522
You like it best
when I have no say in the matter.

441
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:03,246
Don't let it confuse you,
but I have two holes.

442
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:06,174
- Yes.
- Right.

443
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:14,990
So that's why
they call you the boss of it all.

444
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,665
- You are a bastard.
- Yes.

445
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:25,325
- Yes.
- Yes, yes, yes.

446
00:40:25,403 --> 00:40:28,099
Is that all you can say?!

447
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:36,446
- Are you familiar with Gambini?
- Who?

448
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:49,384
You look tired.

449
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:54,762
I told Jokumsen
he couldn't see you today.

450
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:58,962
I told him to try again next week.
Hope that's all right.

451
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:04,372
- That's fine, 'cause I won't be here.
- Are you leaving again?

452
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:11,241
By the way, thanks for all your greetings
from round the world.

453
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:14,247
They meant a lot to me.

454
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:18,814
And I've replied to all of them.

455
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:22,251
Apart from one.

456
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:25,957
Yes.

457
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,123
Yes, that's right.

458
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,235
There was one
you didn't reply to.

459
00:41:33,237 --> 00:41:35,137
Why didn't you?

460
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:40,108
- You want to talk about it now?
- I'm here now.

461
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:42,271
That's true.

462
00:41:46,017 --> 00:41:50,147
You're always making jokes
about everything.

463
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:57,286
Sometimes it confuses me.
I can't tell if you are joking.

464
00:41:57,361 --> 00:42:00,330
Why would you think it was a joke?

465
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:04,626
It could hardly be anything else.

466
00:42:06,204 --> 00:42:10,470
If it hadn't been a joke,
what would you have said?

467
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:17,006
I think you know.

468
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:20,573
No. That's why I am asking.

469
00:42:20,685 --> 00:42:22,915
- If it wasn't a joke...
- Yes.

470
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,715
...I would have said yes.

471
00:42:28,726 --> 00:42:32,492
That's nuts, seeing as
we hardly know each other.

472
00:42:40,571 --> 00:42:43,904
You don't seem thrilled
about my yes.

473
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:49,007
Sorry. How stupid of me.

474
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:52,372
This is embarrassing.

475
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:56,049
That's why I didn't reply.

476
00:42:57,054 --> 00:42:59,887
Of course it was a joke.

477
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:03,723
Yes, and it's funny.

478
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:07,093
I'm so stupid,
I thought you meant it.

479
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:09,689
Sorry. I'm going all red.

480
00:43:10,902 --> 00:43:13,200
I think that...

481
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,570
it's great that
you would have said yes.

482
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:26,281
Not everyone would.
I respect you for it.

483
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:32,550
My goodness. Great.
Can we just forget about it?

484
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:37,993
I can't believe I was so ambiguous
that you were in doubt.

485
00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:42,060
It's not like me.
It's not in character.

486
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:46,729
Sometimes we ask questions in jest
that we'd like an answer to,

487
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:49,204
in case we ever ask for real.

488
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:54,670
I just thought
there were real feelings there.

489
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:56,838
Come on!

490
00:43:58,149 --> 00:44:02,609
You think
I'd cover my bets like that?

491
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,316
And fish for an answer
out of fear?

492
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:11,123
Does that sound
like the boss of it all?

493
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:15,790
A man is a man, a word is a word,
and a boss is a goddamn boss.

494
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,700
I didn't build an empire
by farting around like that.

495
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:23,001
Heidi A.
I remember that mail clearly.

496
00:44:23,107 --> 00:44:27,840
If you ask me whether I meant it,
the answer is yes.

497
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:31,176
And the question still stands.

498
00:44:31,282 --> 00:44:33,011
- Damn right!
- Oh.

499
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:34,709
"Oh" is right.

500
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:38,516
- I'm so happy.
- If you're happy, I'm happy.

501
00:44:38,622 --> 00:44:42,114
It wasn't just
to keep me from quitting?

502
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:47,153
Of course not.
What does that have to do with it?

503
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,531
And I didn't quit.
I stayed with you.

504
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:57,664
- You did.
- Mainly because of your email.

505
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:05,305
Yes, and I think it's time to knock off,
even for the boss.

506
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:11,882
I'm glad we got that little matter
sorted to our mutual satisfaction.

507
00:45:14,592 --> 00:45:18,995
You look like something
is bugging you again.

508
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,428
- Everything will be fine.
- I'm just so happy you meant it.

509
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:31,907
Especially considering
how little you know about me.

510
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:36,070
Isn't there anything
you'd like to ask me?

511
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,206
Of course there is, Heidi A.

512
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:45,712
What does the A stand for?
Not that it matters.

513
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,556
No, because now
it'll be Heidi E.

514
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:54,020
Heidi Eckersberg.

515
00:45:57,868 --> 00:45:59,927
All right, then.

516
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:12,105
<i>Oh, no! Just as things</i>
<i>were working out. Why this break?</i>

517
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:16,209
<i>Not to mention this primitive</i>,
<i>pointless Z O O M?</i>

518
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:20,018
<i>I declare</i>,
<i>no comedy without breaks</i>.

519
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:23,891
<i>Vitamins must be injected</i>,
<i>however reluctant we are</i>.

520
00:46:23,961 --> 00:46:26,987
<i>And who likes being</i>
<i>the doctor with his syringe</i>.

521
00:46:27,098 --> 00:46:32,365
<i>interrupting a child's play?</i>
<i>You're right. Yours truly</i>.

522
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:38,466
<i>And I hereby feel obliged</i>
<i>to introduce a new character</i>.

523
00:46:48,953 --> 00:46:51,478
The boss is horny as hell.

524
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:55,855
There's probably
still a slight trace

525
00:46:56,927 --> 00:46:59,589
of homophilia in his dong.

526
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:03,429
The boss will be right with you.

527
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,531
How was the cred
in that line, toots?

528
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,006
Not bad, "toots."

529
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:17,342
- Kisser! You don't work with IT.
- The same goes for you.

530
00:47:19,116 --> 00:47:21,676
I don't remember
you looking this happy.

531
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:25,516
But we were only married for 5 years.
Or was it 50?

532
00:47:27,124 --> 00:47:33,791
Were you ever happy?
Yes, when drooling over that Gambini jerk.

533
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:38,130
A hoax nobody's ever heard of.

534
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:42,798
A hoax in seven-league boots.
With Gambini, disaster has already struck.

535
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:50,041
A one-act play, three hours long!
<i>The Chimney Sweep's Monologue</i>!

536
00:47:50,147 --> 00:47:55,210
Too much <i>Christmas Carol</i>
for my taste.

537
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:00,814
- No wonder I couldn't stand you.
- I couldn't stand you, either.

538
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,688
- Why not?
- Peanuts.

539
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:12,192
You ate them with the shells on.
They only do that in cartoons.

540
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:18,902
It drove me crazy!
I bet you're here to get something.

541
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:22,911
- Come to win me back?
- I don't want you back.

542
00:48:23,013 --> 00:48:27,780
For something else, then.
You're so damned efficient.

543
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:34,715
I bet you graduated even before
you started. And got promoted.

544
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:38,523
I'm Finnur Sigurdsson's attorney.

545
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:40,291
Wow, capitalism!

546
00:48:41,665 --> 00:48:45,761
Weren't you going
to use your degree to fight it?

547
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:48,133
Yes, I believe I was.

548
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:52,208
Finnur mentioned me,
but you forgot.

549
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:58,237
Life is a dogma film. It's hard to hear,
but the words are still important.

550
00:48:58,315 --> 00:49:02,274
I'm here to assess the likelihood
of the president's presence tomorrow,

551
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:06,447
at the sales talks
with my client.

552
00:49:06,557 --> 00:49:10,926
So far, I have my doubts.
All I know is you're not him.

553
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:14,725
Why couldn't I?
Why couldn't I be the boss of it all?

554
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:18,825
Like the chimney sweep
from <i>The Town without Chimneys</i>?

555
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:24,135
- Always with soot on his forehead.
- Maybe you were wrong.

556
00:49:25,609 --> 00:49:29,636
Maybe there is more to me
than you saw back then.

557
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:31,806
Yes.

558
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:38,012
- But there isn't, is there?
- No.

559
00:49:40,457 --> 00:49:44,018
Not according to
what they teach at law school.

560
00:49:44,128 --> 00:49:46,995
What we learnt was more tangible.

561
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:51,090
Is that really the president,
or isn't he the president?

562
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:54,262
All right, I'm a stand-in.

563
00:49:54,338 --> 00:49:58,798
My lips are sealed.
I signed a non-disclosure agreement.

564
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:01,810
A non-disclosure with old Ravn?

565
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:04,176
Dammit, Kristoffer!

566
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:11,053
He's really got you by the balls.
He's a whiz with contracts.

567
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:15,789
Are you going
to blow the whistle on me?

568
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:22,321
Then I'd have done it ten years ago
when you started acting... toots.

569
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:27,330
- But I see you love the part.
- I am good at it.

570
00:50:27,438 --> 00:50:33,172
Seems so. And parts for you
don't exactly grow on trees.

571
00:50:33,277 --> 00:50:37,213
And it goes against your convictions
to check things thoroughly.

572
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:43,310
- All you want is attention.
- I keep these IT nerds in check.

573
00:50:43,387 --> 00:50:48,188
So that the rightful owner
can do business.

574
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:53,992
In law we say, "Too stupid for words."
And that's you, if you believe Ravn.

575
00:50:54,064 --> 00:50:57,363
Ravn is all right.
We get along fine.

576
00:50:57,434 --> 00:51:02,371
He loves his staff,
but lacks the strength to be the boss.

577
00:51:02,473 --> 00:51:04,998
He's a wuss, but not malicious.

578
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:10,570
Not unless he exploits the system
to drive his staff to the utmost.

579
00:51:10,681 --> 00:51:17,109
By blaming all the shit on this boss
you can appear likable and noble.

580
00:51:17,221 --> 00:51:21,715
- Why do you care?
- I don't.

581
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:27,990
But once I saw
a shred of decency in you.

582
00:51:28,065 --> 00:51:32,365
You're not as bad as
you'd like to be, Kristoffer.

583
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:36,998
You almost looked like
you considered the moral aspects.

584
00:51:37,074 --> 00:51:42,171
All of Ravn's dealings
benefit the company

585
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:47,650
and thereby his staff. This is a
good deal for their beloved workplace.

586
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:52,950
Possibly. And since Ravn is as noble
as you perceive him to be,

587
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:58,255
I'm sure he has told his staff
that their beloved workplace

588
00:51:58,362 --> 00:52:01,627
is the subject of tomorrow's deal.

589
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:09,967
- Is Ravn selling the company?
- Yes. Simple as that.

590
00:52:18,682 --> 00:52:24,143
No, you didn't.
You didn't manipulate me.

591
00:52:24,254 --> 00:52:28,054
You've been quite the gentleman.

592
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:34,121
Even when I almost quit
to work for our worst competitor.

593
00:52:35,132 --> 00:52:38,499
You've laid into Ravn a few times.

594
00:52:38,602 --> 00:52:42,936
He's looked a bit sad
after a phone call from you.

595
00:52:43,006 --> 00:52:44,803
Well...

596
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:49,005
I have to pop down...

597
00:52:49,112 --> 00:52:51,512
to make some copies.

598
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:54,482
Does anyone else feel manipulated?

599
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:58,681
Not me, but Gorm does.

600
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:01,724
That was a serious blow.

601
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:06,524
He took it hard when you overruled
him on the Brooker platform issue.

602
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:10,532
He'd spent two years
on the other platform.

603
00:53:10,634 --> 00:53:16,470
How can you even dictate things
concerning the Brooker? It's ours.

604
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:21,509
Not me, but Nalle does.
You were out of line.

605
00:53:21,612 --> 00:53:24,410
You told him
he never came prepared.

606
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:28,849
Then everyone started in on him.
You knew he'd snap.

607
00:53:30,487 --> 00:53:34,150
Hi. Can I ask you
a question in English?

608
00:53:34,224 --> 00:53:35,191
Danish.

609
00:53:35,259 --> 00:53:37,591
- Let's do it in English.
- No, Danish.

610
00:53:40,397 --> 00:53:45,164
You took away his Danish lessons
so he couldn't gossip in the corridors.

611
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:51,231
- Couldn't he just gossip in English?
- Sure, but he didn't want to.

612
00:53:51,341 --> 00:53:56,244
And me... Not apart from
making me see to Ravn.

613
00:53:56,346 --> 00:53:59,042
But that didn't benefit you.

614
00:54:00,717 --> 00:54:05,586
- What about Ravn?
- Our cuddly teddy bear?

615
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:10,353
You can't help loving him.
Although he's pathetic at times.

616
00:54:11,228 --> 00:54:17,030
Maybe I shouldn't mention it,
but his personal finances are a mess.

617
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:22,863
- How do you know?
- He said so.

618
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:28,344
Mostly at first. Then we discussed it
and decided to lend him 25,000 each.

619
00:54:28,412 --> 00:54:31,904
Not that it helped.

620
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:36,214
- Why not?
- He hasn't paid us back yet.

621
00:54:38,288 --> 00:54:43,248
- And there's Poor Mette.
- Yeah.

622
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:47,627
You know what happened
after you sacked her husband?

623
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:53,101
- No, I don't think so.
- He hung himself.

624
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:58,073
With a printer cable.
He couldn't take being excluded.

625
00:54:58,141 --> 00:55:03,408
He begged to let him come back. Ravn
told us about the letters he sent you.

626
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:10,746
But we had nothing for the guy.

627
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:14,689
No, that's life.

628
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:19,490
- And now she's Poor Mette.
- Where is she?

629
00:55:19,596 --> 00:55:23,862
In the copy room, I guess.

630
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:26,936
- Elisabeth, is the copier working?
- Yes.

631
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:32,205
There.

632
00:56:25,996 --> 00:56:31,696
It's pure fantasy.
There has to be some rumors.

633
00:56:31,768 --> 00:56:36,865
I deserve a bit of goodwill
for starting the business.

634
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,341
They didn't stake the 150,000.

635
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:43,208
That's exactly what they did.

636
00:56:43,313 --> 00:56:48,842
They all lent you money,
and you used it to start the company.

637
00:56:51,421 --> 00:56:56,916
- I know it looks a bit shady.
- It sure does!

638
00:56:57,027 --> 00:57:03,125
I'm the director, you're just the actor.
Ask your character if the pieces fit.

639
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:07,192
I did, and I'm afraid they do.

640
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:10,900
If I'm really such an asshole

641
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:16,104
they're better off selling,
so they're rid of me.

642
00:57:16,213 --> 00:57:20,411
We have to sign
the power of attorney.

643
00:57:20,484 --> 00:57:24,648
I've stipulated a minimum price
so you can't sell for less.

644
00:57:24,755 --> 00:57:29,317
Kristoffer shouldn't put one over
on Svend by selling for a buck.

645
00:57:32,796 --> 00:57:36,596
- Don't I get to keep one?
- If you insist.

646
00:57:37,134 --> 00:57:39,762
I'm no better or worse
than anyone else.

647
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:43,465
- I'm not so sure.
- I feel so misunderstood.

648
00:57:43,573 --> 00:57:47,270
I give and give.
Do I get anything in return?

649
00:57:48,411 --> 00:57:50,971
Rarely, rarely.

650
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:55,313
254 million. Not exactly peanuts.

651
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:59,479
Strindberg was misunderstood, too.

652
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:02,649
People were always talking.

653
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:06,092
They said he pushed his wife
down the stairs.

654
00:58:06,163 --> 00:58:08,859
- And he didn't?
- Sure.

655
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:12,662
But that doesn't make him
any less of a writer.

656
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:31,685
The account number is there, too.
Very handy.

657
00:58:34,224 --> 00:58:37,193
So our Nordic friends
won't have to lug that cash around.

658
00:58:40,897 --> 00:58:45,561
It's not the account number. It's the price.

659
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:49,297
That should more than cover it.

660
00:58:52,209 --> 00:58:57,169
That's the estimated value
of your company, sir.

661
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,738
Shall we sign?

662
00:59:03,153 --> 00:59:05,314
There...

663
00:59:05,388 --> 00:59:08,824
May I draw your attention to

664
00:59:08,892 --> 00:59:12,885
a couple of places
where I've simplified the text?

665
00:59:15,165 --> 00:59:18,498
The clause about
the staff not staying on.

666
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:21,332
Fine. I trust you completely.

667
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:27,973
The staff will stay on, right?

668
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:32,014
That's not what we agreed.

669
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:43,023
We're not getting stuck
with a bunch of fucking Danes.

670
00:59:43,093 --> 00:59:47,587
Mr. Ravn is the only employee
who will stay on.

671
00:59:52,369 --> 00:59:55,634
I also took out
a couple of commas

672
00:59:55,739 --> 01:00:00,870
on the transfer of the Brooker 5
patent from its owner, Mr. Ravn.

673
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:13,881
What do the other rights holders get?

674
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:17,627
Nothing.

675
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:22,557
Mr. Ravn has the sole rights.

676
01:00:28,605 --> 01:00:33,133
The six seniors
think they have rights, too.

677
01:00:33,243 --> 01:00:36,679
Emotionally, maybe.

678
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,146
But legally, no.

679
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:43,345
They worked on the program,
but that was their job.

680
01:00:43,453 --> 01:00:46,445
Excuse me for a moment.

681
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:51,416
Some fresh air might be good.

682
01:00:52,228 --> 01:00:57,325
It's all very touching,
but you can't change anything.

683
01:00:57,434 --> 01:01:00,631
If I don't sell to Finnur,
I'll find another buyer.

684
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:05,801
And you can't screw me
by selling cheaper. Come on.

685
01:01:14,317 --> 01:01:18,651
- Mr. President.
- All right. Let's seal the deal.

686
01:01:20,557 --> 01:01:23,025
About time, too.

687
01:01:27,464 --> 01:01:31,560
It's rather sad
to have to part with all of this.

688
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:38,034
But as Mr. Ravn knows,
I'm a businessman at heart.

689
01:01:42,979 --> 01:01:46,574
Then let's get down to business.

690
01:01:50,553 --> 01:01:56,014
I have really grown fond of this place.

691
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,664
It's been my stage
for quite a few years now.

692
01:02:07,737 --> 01:02:13,573
Lovely thoughts, but it's history.
We have some contracts to sign.

693
01:02:13,676 --> 01:02:16,975
Thanks, Ravn.
Always so helpful.

694
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:21,006
At your service.
Sign right there.

695
01:02:21,084 --> 01:02:25,851
I'll move my finger
so you can get on with it.

696
01:02:25,922 --> 01:02:31,224
Don't you agree, Mr. Finnur?
Mr. Ravn is very helpful.

697
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:39,801
I don't share
your soppy Danish sentimentality.

698
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:46,441
All that's left is to sign.

699
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:53,107
A note to the lawyer
who typed up the contract.

700
01:02:53,216 --> 01:03:00,384
Putting the page number in the
middle of the wording is a bad idea.

701
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:06,054
I don't know
how you do things in Iceland...

702
01:03:07,464 --> 01:03:12,401
It's not the page number.
It's the purchase price.

703
01:03:20,343 --> 01:03:26,373
My copy states
the ridiculous sum of 254 million.

704
01:03:37,293 --> 01:03:40,456
That's what we agreed on,
for fuck's sake.

705
01:03:40,563 --> 01:03:45,660
I can't sell my life's work for that.
Surely you understand.

706
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:55,969
How much does the president
want for his company?

707
01:03:58,181 --> 01:04:03,278
- More than that.
- How much more?

708
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:08,949
50 cents.

709
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:16,728
It's purely symbolic.

710
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:21,133
As a businessman,
I like to feel I have profited.

711
01:04:23,706 --> 01:04:28,507
We talk of free will,
but we heed the machine within.

712
01:04:32,882 --> 01:04:36,215
The machine that wants gold.

713
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:40,415
Ticktock, ticktock...

714
01:04:40,523 --> 01:04:42,252
Ticktock, ticktock...

715
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:44,084
Ticktock, ticktock...

716
01:04:44,327 --> 01:04:45,487
Ticktock, ticktock...

717
01:04:45,562 --> 01:04:47,291
Ticktock, ticktock...

718
01:04:47,497 --> 01:04:49,556
Ticktock, ticktock...

719
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:53,966
Sometimes a mere crumb
can satisfy the hunger.

720
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:59,706
We'll have to retype the contracts.

721
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:03,540
We can amend them by hand.

722
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:14,452
I know it's a
businessman's argument.

723
01:05:14,557 --> 01:05:19,187
But, if I can get 50 cents more...

724
01:05:19,262 --> 01:05:22,959
then I can get 50 million.

725
01:05:25,935 --> 01:05:27,994
Mr. Finnur?

726
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,299
Finnur!

727
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:01,501
There it is!

728
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:06,268
<i>The Town without Chimneys</i>.
It's been there all the time.

729
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:09,641
Everything comes together
for an instant

730
01:06:09,746 --> 01:06:14,240
only to be blown to bits
in a Gambinian explosion.

731
01:06:21,658 --> 01:06:28,188
<i>Sadly, the oft-mentioned Gambini</i>
<i>did not pen our little comedy</i>.

732
01:06:28,298 --> 01:06:34,760
<i>His contempt would have distorted</i>
<i>the genre beyond recognition</i>.

733
01:06:34,837 --> 01:06:37,965
<i>No. I obey the laws of the genre</i>.

734
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:44,173
<i>However beautiful the sight of two</i>
<i>men asking nothing of each other</i>.

735
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,307
<i>we know there are men</i>
<i>who demand things of each other</i>.

736
01:06:48,384 --> 01:06:53,879
<i>And these demands must be met</i>
<i>before we can leave the cinema</i>

737
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:59,121
<i>and with a clear conscience</i>
<i>forget everything we've seen</i>.

738
01:06:59,195 --> 01:07:03,325
- Why the fuck didn't you sign?!
- Shh.

739
01:07:03,433 --> 01:07:05,492
I understand your question.

740
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:09,129
Oh, really?
It's a lot of money.

741
01:07:09,205 --> 01:07:12,333
You piss me off!

742
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:26,311
- I'm sick of your moods.
- You're firing them.

743
01:07:26,389 --> 01:07:30,553
You neglected to say that.
You're robbing them blind.

744
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:36,428
Brooker 5, whatever that is.
You piss me off.

745
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:44,998
You're the company lawyer
<i>and</i> their friend.

746
01:07:45,074 --> 01:07:48,805
You should have told them
they needed contracts.

747
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:51,574
They don't even suspect
they're losing their jobs.

748
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:58,250
- It's a bit harsh.
- No shit.

749
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:04,719
Let's just finish the deal.

750
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:09,288
That was the whole idea,
but I'm willing to make a trade-off.

751
01:08:09,399 --> 01:08:13,426
Confess!
Tell them you're sacking them.

752
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:16,266
- I promise.
- I don't trust you.

753
01:08:16,372 --> 01:08:20,001
All you've done is trick me.

754
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:30,449
Sign this promise, confessing you're
firing them and taking their rights.

755
01:08:30,553 --> 01:08:33,613
I have done what I could.

756
01:08:33,723 --> 01:08:37,159
I'm not thrilled
about signing something.

757
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:43,165
The idea is God. You said so yourself.
Even if Hitler was the writer.

758
01:08:43,266 --> 01:08:47,566
At the time, I didn't know
the writer <i>was</i> Hitler.

759
01:08:47,637 --> 01:08:51,129
If you're serious about confessing,
then sign it.

760
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:57,145
And a maximum price,
to stop you pulling these stunts.

761
01:08:57,246 --> 01:09:00,738
Shut up down there!

762
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:25,803
Today... is a very grave day.

763
01:09:29,512 --> 01:09:35,348
I have decided to tell you something

764
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:38,511
I should have told you ages ago.

765
01:09:45,228 --> 01:09:47,355
I can't do this...

766
01:09:47,463 --> 01:09:52,526
- You don't have to say it.
- Let him get on with it.

767
01:09:54,637 --> 01:09:56,867
Yes, I do.

768
01:10:03,312 --> 01:10:06,941
Who never lets us down?

769
01:10:08,217 --> 01:10:09,844
Ravn

770
01:10:10,219 --> 01:10:13,677
In whose arms do we drown?

771
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:15,584
Ravn's

772
01:10:15,691 --> 01:10:20,185
Who deserves the crown?

773
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:24,029
Ravn, Ravn, Ravn...

774
01:10:28,504 --> 01:10:32,338
You're all so sweet.
It just makes it worse.

775
01:10:32,408 --> 01:10:35,969
If it's really important,
just get it over with.

776
01:10:36,045 --> 01:10:42,609
- You'll be angry.
- We'll be angrier if you don't.

777
01:10:42,718 --> 01:10:46,916
I've been planning something.

778
01:10:47,023 --> 01:10:50,424
What have you been planning?

779
01:10:53,863 --> 01:10:59,859
- To fire all six of you.
- Excuse me?

780
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:08,267
To fire you without
any compensation for Brooker 5.

781
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:15,276
That's quite a plan.

782
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:21,089
Dammit, Ravn.

783
01:11:21,157 --> 01:11:23,284
- Dammit, Ravn.
- Dammit.

784
01:11:23,392 --> 01:11:26,225
- Ravn, dammit.
- Dammit.

785
01:11:26,295 --> 01:11:29,753
Dammit, Ravn!

786
01:11:29,865 --> 01:11:32,891
Holy shit.

787
01:11:35,538 --> 01:11:41,602
May I pose a question
before we all attack Ravn?

788
01:11:41,711 --> 01:11:46,478
Why did you plan this, Ravn?
Why fire us?

789
01:11:47,049 --> 01:11:50,610
- Why cheat us out of Brooker 5?
- Because...

790
01:11:50,686 --> 01:11:52,984
Yes?

791
01:11:53,089 --> 01:11:55,956
Because...

792
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:04,960
The boss of it all said so.

793
01:12:17,113 --> 01:12:20,344
I should've known.

794
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:25,680
He didn't even have the guts
to tell us himself.

795
01:12:34,497 --> 01:12:37,728
- Autumn is muggy.
- Gorm...

796
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:42,133
- Autumn is muggy.
- Stop it.

797
01:12:42,204 --> 01:12:47,369
Autumn is fucking muggy!

798
01:12:48,544 --> 01:12:50,705
Gorm! Stop it!

799
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:07,520
I didn't have the guts after all.
They've got memories like...

800
01:13:07,596 --> 01:13:11,760
like... like...

801
01:13:11,867 --> 01:13:15,064
Elephants?

802
01:13:18,074 --> 01:13:23,569
Yes. I lie awake at night.
I see their eyes before me.

803
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:29,117
Forgiveness, you say!
They'll never forgive me.

804
01:13:29,218 --> 01:13:31,880
Poor Mette is the worst.

805
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:35,685
Nothing I say
is good enough for that girl.

806
01:13:35,758 --> 01:13:38,386
I'm such a wuss!

807
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:44,093
They can't forgive you if you
don't confess. We had a contract.

808
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:49,035
"I promise to confess."

809
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:54,176
- Who signed?
- I confessed to my plan.

810
01:13:54,243 --> 01:13:59,078
And told them that I forced you!
That's not a confession.

811
01:13:59,181 --> 01:14:04,551
- That's not what I meant.
- Why didn't the contract say so?

812
01:14:05,788 --> 01:14:11,055
Unfortunately for you,
law is an extremely exact science.

813
01:14:11,127 --> 01:14:14,619
And therefore I demand

814
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:19,224
that you honor the contracts
you have signed, and sell.

815
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:22,270
I've set up
one last meeting with Finnur.

816
01:14:22,338 --> 01:14:26,638
You don't want
to show your face at work.

817
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:30,200
So I've told them
you're in the States

818
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:32,975
until the day of the signing.

819
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:51,326
Hi. It's me. We have to meet.
On neutral ground.

820
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:04,070
Mm!

821
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:11,477
Legally, you can't touch him.
He's got you. You have to sell.

822
01:15:11,554 --> 01:15:16,958
- It's a total downer.
- Yes.

823
01:15:17,026 --> 01:15:20,291
But he almost confessed, right?

824
01:15:20,362 --> 01:15:25,527
You have a knack
for deliberate mental cruelty.

825
01:15:25,634 --> 01:15:27,898
You're right.

826
01:15:28,003 --> 01:15:32,463
But I'm better at being irritating
on an intuitive level.

827
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:34,839
What's his greatest fear?

828
01:15:36,812 --> 01:15:40,680
Not being loved.
That's what it's all about.

829
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:46,312
He wants to be the big, cuddly teddy,
otherwise he loses it.

830
01:15:46,388 --> 01:15:51,052
Take his place
as the cuddly teddy bear.

831
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,994
Do what Ravn did.
Only better.

832
01:15:59,435 --> 01:16:02,370
Mm!

833
01:16:06,008 --> 01:16:08,067
Good morning.

834
01:16:09,411 --> 01:16:11,845
Hello there.

835
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:32,165
Do you have room
for tiny little me?

836
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:39,100
Ravn!
Won't you join us?

837
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:41,733
The more the merrier.

838
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,711
We thought
you were in the States.

839
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:50,480
I was supposed to be. But I can see
my valued U.S. buddies any time.

840
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:55,046
But my most invaluable friends...

841
01:16:55,124 --> 01:16:59,117
I have only two more days with.

842
01:16:59,228 --> 01:17:02,789
- Right, Ravn?
- Yes.

843
01:17:02,898 --> 01:17:06,265
Two more days
in the bosom of the family.

844
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:11,063
Autumn is
a meteorological bombshell.

845
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:16,305
Speaking of bombshells,
I have a confession to make.

846
01:17:16,412 --> 01:17:20,849
Things got a bit heated last time.

847
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:27,583
But when I tell you why I really came,
you'll see you were wrong about me.

848
01:17:27,656 --> 01:17:31,422
- You're a bastard.
- Quite possibly.

849
01:17:31,493 --> 01:17:33,961
But maybe
not the way you think.

850
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:40,627
I've been withholding
information from you.

851
01:17:40,703 --> 01:17:45,333
That makes everything much better.
Gee, thanks, we forgive you.

852
01:17:45,441 --> 01:17:51,607
I haven't been acting alone.
There has been someone in the wings.

853
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:58,882
This person deserves
to be brought out into the light.

854
01:17:58,988 --> 01:18:05,052
It's someone above me.
My superior, my boss.

855
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:09,119
- It's getting very technical.
- And who might that be?

856
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:11,359
It is...

857
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:16,567
...the boss of the boss of it all.

858
01:18:21,643 --> 01:18:23,804
Now it's getting really complicated.

859
01:18:23,879 --> 01:18:27,042
Can anybody tell me what this means?

860
01:18:27,149 --> 01:18:29,674
No.

861
01:18:29,752 --> 01:18:33,745
So where is this boss
of the boss of it all?

862
01:18:33,856 --> 01:18:37,986
In America.
No surprise there.

863
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:44,260
So you're not the real boss
who makes the decisions?

864
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,336
I've had to disappoint Jokumsen
on that point, too.

865
01:18:50,406 --> 01:18:55,844
All his anger and reproaches must,
like yours,

866
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:58,709
find a new target.

867
01:19:01,183 --> 01:19:03,549
I'm glad to hear it.

868
01:19:10,225 --> 01:19:14,685
You're all right, Svend.
I could tell right away.

869
01:19:14,763 --> 01:19:19,063
We hicks
have to know these things.

870
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:24,538
As the boss' representative,

871
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:30,545
allow me to apologize
for the Brooker platform business.

872
01:19:30,612 --> 01:19:34,878
Because you were right all along.

873
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:39,117
You can't help loving him, right?

874
01:19:42,124 --> 01:19:45,890
And to raise our spirits
even more...

875
01:19:45,961 --> 01:19:50,898
The staff outing to Kullen
is set for tomorrow.

876
01:19:50,966 --> 01:19:55,130
- Great!
- Let's have one fun day together.

877
01:19:55,237 --> 01:19:58,832
How about a big group hug?
Come on, Ravn!

878
01:20:08,317 --> 01:20:13,584
- Come on, Mette!
- Go, Poor Mette!

879
01:20:25,434 --> 01:20:28,426
What are you hoping to achieve?

880
01:20:28,504 --> 01:20:31,371
Nothing.
We're just having fun.

881
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:35,836
Right here!

882
01:20:35,944 --> 01:20:41,507
Palnatoke bragged to Harald Bluetooth
about how great a skier he was.

883
01:20:41,617 --> 01:20:46,953
"If you're that great,
ski down the Kullen from here."

884
01:20:47,022 --> 01:20:50,856
- And he did, right here.
- Then what?

885
01:20:50,959 --> 01:20:56,454
- Eh, I didn't read that far.
- A human fault. You're evolving.

886
01:20:56,532 --> 01:21:01,299
And now Palnatoke
will demonstrate

887
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:04,168
his own unique Telemark style!

888
01:21:17,619 --> 01:21:21,055
- Ouch!
- What's with your hand?

889
01:21:21,156 --> 01:21:25,183
It's my wrist. It's gone...

890
01:21:25,294 --> 01:21:31,130
limp again.
I'm afraid it's a relapse.

891
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,432
We'll soon fix that.

892
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:50,848
The most resilient of men

893
01:21:50,919 --> 01:21:53,046
Svend

894
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:56,648
Our new-found dearest friend

895
01:21:56,725 --> 01:21:58,215
Svend

896
01:21:58,293 --> 01:22:02,559
Eleven out of ten

897
01:22:03,265 --> 01:22:06,792
Svend, Svend, Svend

898
01:22:10,706 --> 01:22:13,231
More brandy, please!

899
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:20,872
I can't take it anymore.
What a bunch of parasites!

900
01:22:23,051 --> 01:22:28,148
I'm telling the boss
of the boss of it all.

901
01:22:28,257 --> 01:22:35,060
The way you're wasting his money.
You disgust me!

902
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:47,404
You've found a crack.

903
01:22:47,476 --> 01:22:51,105
He is extremely corny,
to put it mildly.

904
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:55,809
So you need corny theater.
You haven't been aiming low enough.

905
01:22:55,917 --> 01:23:00,081
Living-room realism,
sentimentality...

906
01:23:00,155 --> 01:23:04,785
And clichés.
Clichés, clichés.

907
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:10,798
Are you coming?

908
01:23:12,134 --> 01:23:15,763
It's time. Come on.

909
01:23:27,149 --> 01:23:34,248
- Why are you at the meeting?
- Because boss of it all...

910
01:23:34,323 --> 01:23:37,656
Because the boss of it all
said so, yes.

911
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:53,803
We'll be in our cars
five minutes from now.

912
01:23:56,345 --> 01:24:00,008
- Do we agree this time?
- Yes.

913
01:24:03,552 --> 01:24:07,113
- On the price and terms?
- Yes.

914
01:24:09,124 --> 01:24:12,059
- Let's just sign.
- Yes.

915
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:18,099
And because everything is settled,
allow me to send a message...

916
01:24:22,404 --> 01:24:26,932
These dates are all wrong.
How embarrassing!

917
01:24:27,042 --> 01:24:29,340
I'll correct them. Sorry.

918
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:31,504
...a message.

919
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:35,539
At Aunt Titty and Uncle Carl's
wedding anniversary...

920
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:39,348
a collection was made
in an old sock.

921
01:24:41,022 --> 01:24:47,188
But here we've been collecting
every single day for ten years.

922
01:24:47,262 --> 01:24:50,561
Right here.

923
01:24:50,665 --> 01:24:55,364
The day came
for Aunt Titty and Uncle Carl,

924
01:24:55,437 --> 01:24:59,601
as it will for us,
when the party is over.

925
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:07,246
We wake up one morning
and put out our hands...

926
01:25:08,283 --> 01:25:11,775
...and all we grasp is thin air.

927
01:25:14,756 --> 01:25:17,247
And you,

928
01:25:17,325 --> 01:25:19,725
and me,

929
01:25:19,795 --> 01:25:21,660
and the two of us,

930
01:25:21,763 --> 01:25:26,496
these three people are but a saga.

931
01:25:32,073 --> 01:25:36,737
You, who were once my very life,

932
01:25:36,812 --> 01:25:40,441
and I, who was once yours,

933
01:25:40,549 --> 01:25:44,110
shall never again hold hands.

934
01:25:46,621 --> 01:25:49,749
And to whom
is this message addressed?

935
01:25:49,825 --> 01:25:55,627
The man who is always the first
to curse himself for his mistakes,

936
01:25:55,697 --> 01:25:59,861
but the first to forgive us ours.

937
01:25:59,968 --> 01:26:04,371
- Who do I mean?
- Ravn...

938
01:26:04,473 --> 01:26:08,273
- Louder!
- Ravn.

939
01:26:08,343 --> 01:26:12,609
You carried us
in your heart, Ravn.

940
01:26:14,816 --> 01:26:20,516
You brought us together.
You gave generously of your love.

941
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:26,183
And now you're going away...

942
01:26:26,294 --> 01:26:30,060
like bubbles in the bay.

943
01:26:30,165 --> 01:26:35,125
On your way to greater deeds.
But one thing we promise.

944
01:26:35,203 --> 01:26:39,401
Whether begging or biting,
near or far,

945
01:26:39,508 --> 01:26:42,739
your home will always be

946
01:26:42,844 --> 01:26:47,645
in our hearts,
in this green and pleasant land.

947
01:26:49,017 --> 01:26:52,817
Always.
You were always there for us.

948
01:26:52,888 --> 01:26:57,018
But, dammit,
who was there for you?

949
01:26:57,092 --> 01:27:03,520
And know this, as the swallow
twittered beneath the eaves,

950
01:27:03,632 --> 01:27:06,897
this is not adieu, but au revoir!

951
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:33,550
Thanks for your words.
May they be the last.

952
01:27:41,937 --> 01:27:45,737
Thanks for sentimentality
so nauseating

953
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:51,073
that no living creature
could possibly take it seriously.

954
01:28:05,126 --> 01:28:08,095
Do you have something to say,
Mr. Ravn?

955
01:28:08,163 --> 01:28:12,099
Is there anything
we have overlooked?

956
01:28:15,403 --> 01:28:18,497
Do tell us, Mr. Ravn.

957
01:28:30,952 --> 01:28:34,945
I'm the boss of it all.

958
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:39,492
I own the company.

959
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:44,230
I make the decisions.

960
01:28:59,347 --> 01:29:02,077
Gorm is right.

961
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:05,916
He is right.
Autumn is muggy.

962
01:29:05,987 --> 01:29:08,956
Real muggy.

963
01:29:09,024 --> 01:29:11,822
Gaggingly muggy.

964
01:29:25,206 --> 01:29:27,731
I'm sorry.

965
01:29:27,976 --> 01:29:29,841
I'm sorry.

966
01:29:33,048 --> 01:29:36,415
Thank you, Ravn.

967
01:29:41,389 --> 01:29:44,688
Was it really so hard to say?

968
01:29:47,896 --> 01:29:51,957
I always knew
you were the boss.

969
01:29:52,033 --> 01:29:56,595
You'd have to be stupid
not to see that.

970
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:02,905
I forgive you, Ravn.

971
01:30:10,819 --> 01:30:13,549
Come on.

972
01:30:13,655 --> 01:30:17,091
On your feet...
Upsy-daisy.

973
01:30:17,192 --> 01:30:19,251
All the way.

974
01:30:30,371 --> 01:30:33,431
What about that signature?

975
01:30:34,909 --> 01:30:36,740
Are you going to sell, or what?

976
01:30:39,447 --> 01:30:41,881
That might be tricky.

977
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:46,319
How can Kristoffer sell
what's never been his?

978
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:53,290
No, Mr. Sigurdsson,
there will be no sale.

979
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:58,422
The company
is more strongly united than ever.

980
01:30:59,901 --> 01:31:04,304
And more so, when I've put right
a few sins of the past.

981
01:31:04,405 --> 01:31:08,136
I have some offshoring to see to.

982
01:31:11,579 --> 01:31:14,946
Outsourcing!

983
01:31:16,951 --> 01:31:22,821
The word is outsourcing.
You said offshoring. It's outsourcing.

984
01:31:22,924 --> 01:31:28,123
What you're doing right now
is what irritates me the most.

985
01:31:28,196 --> 01:31:30,926
You're forgetting the actor.

986
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,966
You're right. Sorry.

987
01:31:35,036 --> 01:31:38,631
Kristoffer deserves the credit
for making me confess.

988
01:31:38,706 --> 01:31:43,370
- Everything's due to you.
- That's all very well.

989
01:31:44,979 --> 01:31:47,345
But that's not how it works.

990
01:31:47,448 --> 01:31:51,817
You don't just jump
from hell to happily-ever-after.

991
01:31:51,886 --> 01:31:56,846
There are certain formalities
that have to be kept.

992
01:31:56,958 --> 01:32:00,291
You're right!

993
01:32:00,361 --> 01:32:04,627
Let's annul these
fucking contracts right now.

994
01:32:07,168 --> 01:32:14,165
And now you just waive
the power of attorney to sell the firm.

995
01:32:14,242 --> 01:32:17,575
- No.
- What?

996
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:19,977
No. No, no, no.

997
01:32:20,048 --> 01:32:27,386
There are binding commitments
you can't annul by the stroke of a pen.

998
01:32:27,488 --> 01:32:31,822
We are no longer interested
in a deal

999
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:38,731
since it's clear that the man with
the pen is not the company's legal owner.

1000
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:42,530
From his reading of the sagas
my client knows

1001
01:32:42,604 --> 01:32:46,938
that he who deals with stooges
deals with nobody.

1002
01:32:54,916 --> 01:33:00,912
Our client just remembered
some new scriptures

1003
01:33:01,022 --> 01:33:06,255
that indicate
a more modern interpretation.

1004
01:33:06,361 --> 01:33:09,922
More appropriately rendered:

1005
01:33:10,031 --> 01:33:15,025
"He who deals with a man without
power of attorney deals with nobody."

1006
01:33:17,105 --> 01:33:21,235
As our client sees it,
the man with the pen

1007
01:33:21,309 --> 01:33:27,043
is indeed furnished with
power of attorney, and that's fine with him.

1008
01:33:30,485 --> 01:33:35,184
What's going on, Kristoffer?
It worked out like you wanted.

1009
01:33:35,256 --> 01:33:38,783
Yeah, more or less.

1010
01:33:38,893 --> 01:33:44,832
- You're not thinking of signing!
- It's beyond me. I'm an actor.

1011
01:33:44,933 --> 01:33:49,893
Whether I sign or not
is up to my character.

1012
01:33:49,971 --> 01:33:52,838
I'll have to ask him.

1013
01:33:52,941 --> 01:33:55,671
But your character
is to blame for all this.

1014
01:33:55,777 --> 01:33:58,405
It's probably just a formality.

1015
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:01,971
I need space
to consult my character.

1016
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:05,143
After all,
he is the boss of it all.

1017
01:34:08,957 --> 01:34:11,255
What's going on?

1018
01:34:11,326 --> 01:34:15,262
He's being contrary.
He's an actor.

1019
01:34:15,330 --> 01:34:19,767
He couldn't stand it
when Ravn got all the attention.

1020
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:24,669
He's just putting on a show,
now that everyone is looking at him.

1021
01:34:24,772 --> 01:34:27,434
I hope...

1022
01:34:41,856 --> 01:34:45,087
No!
Hang on a moment.

1023
01:34:50,298 --> 01:34:53,734
I can't make final contact.

1024
01:34:53,835 --> 01:34:58,067
I seem to hear
the boss saying something.

1025
01:34:58,172 --> 01:35:02,131
And then it might be the opposite.

1026
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:05,702
Silence in the back! Shh!

1027
01:35:05,813 --> 01:35:11,183
You have to breathe life
into your material.

1028
01:35:11,285 --> 01:35:15,449
What are your
character's moral values?

1029
01:35:15,523 --> 01:35:17,718
It's fascinating.

1030
01:35:21,829 --> 01:35:26,596
And let me be completely frank...

1031
01:35:27,902 --> 01:35:30,700
I haven't the slightest clue.

1032
01:35:30,805 --> 01:35:37,074
There are sympathies and antipathies,
trying to cancel each other out.

1033
01:35:37,178 --> 01:35:40,739
I'll just listen some more.

1034
01:35:49,023 --> 01:35:52,015
I got it.

1035
01:35:59,734 --> 01:36:03,568
Close call,
but the sympathy meter needle

1036
01:36:03,638 --> 01:36:08,598
just managed to sway
in favor of Ravn and his staff.

1037
01:36:12,447 --> 01:36:16,941
You shitty, shitty,
shit-faced Danes.

1038
01:36:17,051 --> 01:36:22,250
With all your damned chatter.
You gave us 400 years of torment.

1039
01:36:24,225 --> 01:36:27,490
Is the idiot going to sign or not?

1040
01:36:30,298 --> 01:36:33,461
I abhor the Danish race.

1041
01:36:40,408 --> 01:36:43,900
What was the last thing?

1042
01:36:43,978 --> 01:36:50,440
He said the whole business
was absurd. As absurd as...

1043
01:36:50,518 --> 01:36:53,453
Gambini.

1044
01:36:53,521 --> 01:36:56,581
Gambini?

1045
01:36:56,657 --> 01:36:59,387
Antonio Stavro Gambini?

1046
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:03,328
<i>The Hanged Cat</i>.
One act, 1969.

1047
01:37:08,369 --> 01:37:10,929
Some say late 1968.

1048
01:37:14,275 --> 01:37:17,176
Oh, shit.

1049
01:38:12,533 --> 01:38:16,401
Forget it. It's Gambini.

1050
01:38:34,422 --> 01:38:38,051
The chimney sweep's monologue.

1051
01:38:43,764 --> 01:38:48,098
<i>And so we reached</i>,
<i>on the verge of giving up</i>.

1052
01:38:48,202 --> 01:38:50,568
<i>the end of our comedy</i>.

1053
01:38:50,638 --> 01:38:56,508
<i>Like you. I would like to get home</i>,
<i>but I'd like to apologize</i>

1054
01:38:56,577 --> 01:39:01,071
<i>to those who wanted more</i>
<i>and those who wanted less</i>.

1055
01:39:01,148 --> 01:39:05,209
<i>Those who got</i>
<i>what they came for</i>... <i>deserve it</i>.
